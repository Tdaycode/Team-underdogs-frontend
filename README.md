# Team-underdogs - Frontend Repo

### CoinBase Exchange App

Welcome to master branch

This branch is for final deployment

There is a set of rules to follow while working:
Please remember this categories of commit:

```
feature => use feat
chore => use ch
bug => use bg
```

**For a feature:**
`git commit -m "feat: implement user sign up`

**For a bug:**
`git commit -m "bg: fix redirect"`

**For a chore:**
`git commit -m "ch: update docs to include api endpoints`

**Note:** For every feature, bug or chore, you must create a new branch.

Example of a feature?
User Sign up: Branch naming convention follow this pattern: feat/user-signup (- - - lower case and separated by dashes)

Example of a bug?
Sign up page routing typo: Branch naming convention follow this pattern: bg/signup-typo

Example of a chore?
Update Read Me: Branch naming convention follow this pattern: branch naming: ch/update-readme

Once you are assigned a task on trello, create a branch on your local git and only push to that branch. If you push to any other branch.

Run: `git checkout -b <nameOfBranch>`

**Don’t forget the naming convention of branch.**

Note: <nameOfBranch> should be replaced with the feature you are working on (i.e feat/signup-component), use hypen when you will normally use space

`git commit -m "feat/designed login page"` ❌

`git commit -m "bug/fixed login page header bug"` ❌

git push origin feat/signup-component-design - (Note how it ends with a branch).
